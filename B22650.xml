            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Brief ACCOƲNT of the <hi>Qualifications, Vertues</hi> and <hi>Use of that Incomparable EXTRACTUM HUMORALE,</hi> Called also <hi>PANARETON,</hi> From that Ʋniversal Operation it hath upon all <hi>Humoral Diseases,</hi> that is, Proceeding from <hi>Evil</hi> or <hi>Corrupt Humours.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">Prepared by EDWARD IEWEL Dr. of Physick, and known by the Name of his PILLS.</head>
            <p>IF there be any <hi>Preheminence,</hi> if any <hi>Excellence</hi> in any one thing in its kind, to make it distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable from others, it must needs consist in the <hi>Communicative Good, Vertue</hi> and <hi>General Ʋsefulness thereof,</hi> which (to the ingenuous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd Reader) will plainly appear to be true of this Noble Medicine. <hi>My PILL,</hi> being by two <hi>Grand Qualifications</hi> deservedly preferred before others.</p>
            <p>The First of which is that, which is call'd by our <hi>Greek Authors</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that is to say, <hi>A Working by Election</hi> or <hi>Choice of Matter,</hi> by sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, dividing and carrying off such, (and only such) Humours, as being either superfluous, do oppress and indispose the Body, or else being vicious and corrupt, do mix with the Blood, and sweet Nourishing Juices, or Humors thereof, putrifie and corrupt them also, and make them prone to run into infinite sorts of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, of which we see every year produce new ones, <hi>And we at this day by sad Experience find the truth hereof, in the Loss of many Lives, both in City and Countrey, both which suffer under the Contagion of a strange, put id and malignant Feaver;</hi> To prevent which, it were both safe and necessary for every one who is yet in Health, to take some Doses of my <hi>Pills,</hi> which if taken before Infection prevents it; so also it doth where the <hi>Small Pox, Measles,</hi> or other <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant Diseases</hi> do infest any Town or Place. This I I say is the one Qualification of my <hi>Pills,</hi> that they do after a most admirable manner separate and draw a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>way those Humours, which are prepared to form Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, and by that means do Radically Cure them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>other Qualification</hi> of this Great Medicine, rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the <hi>due, Measure of its Working,</hi> for therein it holds such a Proportion with the strength of the Body, that it never hazards <hi>an Hypercatharsis or over-Work<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but effectually prepares and draws together all superfluous humours, and such as are corrupted and putrid, and carries rhem gently off, without Griping or other churlish Working, leaving the Body refreshed and disposed to a lasting state of Health. These are the two Eminent Qualifications of my <hi>Pills,</hi> and <hi>such they are!</hi> as shall not only serve this present Age, but recommend them to the good and benefit of those which are to come.</p>
            <p>But after this General Account I have given of this Noble Medicine, my <hi>Pills,</hi> I now come to be more particular, and to let you know how they make their Progress through the Body. First, <hi>They cleanse the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> which (as it is design'd by God and Nature, to Concoct the Food, and distribute Nourishment to the whole Body, so) by the Power and Faculties thereof, being hurt and depraved, is the Fountain of most Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, which annoy and in time destroy it; For it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries off all its Crucities, and vicious, tough, clammy and waterish Humors, with which it is loaden and stuff'd, and by which many sore Diseases are caused, as <hi>Obstructions, Flushings, windy Belchings, Fumes, Head ach, Surfeits, Griping in the Guts, Vomiting, Loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Fainting Loss of Appetite</hi> &amp; a multitude of others which would be too tedious to mention, and leave the Stomach mightily strengthned, and in good order.</p>
            <p>When it hath wrought effectually in the Stomach, it passeth (with its Vertue) into the Bowels, cleanseth the <hi>Liver, Spleen, Gall, Mesentery,</hi> takes away their Obstructions, empties them of all Superfluities, and strengthens their Faculties. By this means, it excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently Cures all sorts of the <hi>Dropscy,</hi> gently, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and with safety, discharging the Belly and other parts of that serous watery humour which affects them: Thus it helps the <hi>Scurvey,</hi> purging away those salt, briny, melancholy, sharp humours, which so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally indispose the Body. <hi>For a more large Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof, I refer you to my Book, which shall be Given given with my Pills.</hi> So also they help the <hi>Jaundies</hi> of both sorts, <hi>Cholick, Melancholy, Sighing, Pains in the Sids and Back, windy Vapours, difficult Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and others which depend on these Parts; Hence it proceeding through the <hi>small Guts,</hi> draws from the <hi>Reins, Ʋreters, Bladder, Womb</hi> and <hi>seminal Vessels,</hi> all viscous or slimy matter, which causeth <hi>Gravel</hi> and <hi>Stone, Strangury</hi> or <hi>Diabetes.</hi> Also the Malign Humors, which affect the Seminal and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Parts. For, beside its Sufficiencie to help in
<pb facs="tcp:195862:2"/> all other Weaknesses in those Parts.</p>
            <p>They have a peculiar Property in Curing <hi>the Run<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Reins,</hi> though <hi>highly virulent;</hi> And when it is Heightned into the POX, it Cures that too; For these Pills contain in them the true Antidote against the POX, and do with great Ease and Efficacie dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solve and draw away the Malignide thereof, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never fails to Cure its most inveterate Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes; Provided the Patient have strength and vigour enough left to cooperate with the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; But here is Required more then ordinary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in Attending the Cure, both in constant take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Pills,</hi> and observing a slender (but wholesom) Diet during the Cure.</p>
            <p>They are to be taken at Night going to Bed, and Work the next Morning; Begin with Four or Five, and use more or fewer, as you find them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to your strength; You may swallow them in beer, Ale, Apple Pap, or any other thing greateful to your Palate, and the next day go abroad about your Occasions. A more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account is Given of them in a Book which is Given with the <hi>Pills,</hi> which are put up in Tin Boxes, two Dozen in every Box; And Seal'd with the Crest of my Coat of Armes, being <hi>An Eagles Head Eras'd.</hi> Price 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 d.</p>
